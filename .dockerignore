# --- MuseTalk Specific Exclusions from your LOCAL clone ---
# The Dockerfile will COPY the contents of Magenta AI/MuseTalk/MuseTalk/ (the code)
# BUT we want to exclude very large subdirectories from that COPY operation's CONTEXT,
# as the Dockerfile handles some of these differently (e.g., downloads weights).

MuseTalk/MuseTalk/.git/         # Exclude the .git history of your local MuseTalk clone
MuseTalk/MuseTalk/models/       # Exclude your LOCAL downloaded WEIGHTS; Dockerfile will download fresh ones.
