WORKDIR /app
COPY MuseTalk /app/MuseTalk_project

# --- THE DEBUGGING STEP ---
# This command will first list the contents of /app/MuseTalk_project.
# Then it will try to list the contents of a subdirectory. If the subdirectory
# name is wrong, the build will fail here and show us the output of the first ls.
RUN ls -la /app/MuseTalk_project && ls -la /app/MuseTalk_project/THIS_WILL_FAIL
